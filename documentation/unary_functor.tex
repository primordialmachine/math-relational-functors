\section{\textit{concept UnaryFunctor}}
A \textit{UnaryFunctor} is a \textit{Functor} with two template arguments
\verb+OPERAND+,
and
\verb+ENABLED+.
Specializations of this type must provide a constant \verb+operator()+ with one parameter
\verb+operand+ of type \verb+OPERAND+ (or a cv-qualified variant of that). The    default
type of \verb+ENABLED+ is \verb+void+. Specializations of this type may use           the
\verb+ENABLED+ argument to perform \textit{SFINAE}. The operator shall be    qualified as
\texttt{noexcept} and \texttt{constexpr} if possible.\newline

\noindent{}A \textit{UnaryFunctor} represents the unary expression $\circ\texttt{operand}$
where $\circ$ is a unary operator and        $\texttt{operand}$ is its operand.\newline

\noindent{}The return value of the \verb+operator()+ shall represent the result of     the
operation $\circ\texttt{operand}$.
