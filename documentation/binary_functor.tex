\section{\textit{concept BinaryFunctor}}
A \textit{BinaryFunctor} is a \textit{Functor} with three template arguments
\verb+LEFT_OPERAND+,
\verb+RIGHT_OPERAND+,
and
\verb+ENABLED+.
Specializations of this type must provide a constant \verb+operator()+ with two parameters
\verb+left_operand+  of type \verb+LEFT_OPERAND+  (or a cv-qualified variant of that)
and
\verb+right_operand+ of type \verb+RIGHT_OPERAND+ (or a cv-qualified variant of that)
. The default type of \verb+ENABLED+ is \verb+void+. Specializations of this type may
use     the \verb+ENABLED+ argument to perform \textit{SFINAE}. The operator shall be
qualified as \texttt{noexcept} and \texttt{constexpr} if possible. \newline

\noindent{}A \textit{BinaryFunctor} represents the binary expression $\texttt{left\_operand} \circ \texttt{right\_operand}$
where $\circ$ is the binary operator    and $\texttt{left\_operand}$ and $\texttt{right\_operand}$ its operands. \newline

\noindent{}The return value of the operator shall represent the result of the operation $\texttt{left\_operand} \circ \textit{right\_operand}$.
