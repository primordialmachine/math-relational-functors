\section{\texttt{namespace primordialmachine}}
The namespace this library is adding its declarations/definitions to.
The added namespace elements are documented below.

\input{functors}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{\texttt{struct equal\_to\_functor}}
A \textit{BinaryFunctorBase} representing the binary expression
$\texttt{left\_operand} = \texttt{right\_operand}$
denoting wether the values are equal.\newline

\noindent{}This library provides \textit{BinaryFunctor}         specializations for
\texttt{LEFT\_OPERAND} and   \texttt{RIGHT\_OPERAND} being     floating point types
which compute if \texttt{left\_operand} and \texttt{right\_operand} are not  equal.
\texttt{result\_type} is \texttt{bool}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{\texttt{struct not\_equal\_to\_functor}}
A \textit{BinaryFunctorBase} representing the binary expression
$\texttt{left\_operand} \neq \texttt{right\_operand}$
denoting wether the values are not equal.\newline

\noindent{}This library provides \textit{BinaryFunctor}         specializations for
\texttt{LEFT\_OPERAND} and   \texttt{RIGHT\_OPERAND} being     floating point types
which compute if \texttt{left\_operand} and \texttt{right\_operand} are not  equal.
\texttt{result\_type} is \texttt{bool}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{\texttt{struct lower\_than\_functor}}
A \textit{BinaryFunctorBase} representing the binary expression
$\texttt{left\_operand} < \texttt{right\_operand}$
denoting wether the left value is smaller than the right value.\newline

\noindent{}This library provides \textit{BinaryFunctor}         specializations for
\texttt{LEFT\_OPERAND} and   \texttt{RIGHT\_OPERAND} being     floating point types
which compute if \texttt{left\_operand}      is lower than \texttt{right\_operand}.
\texttt{result\_type} is \texttt{bool}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{\texttt{struct lower\_than\_or\_equal\_to\_functor}}
A \textit{BinaryFunctorBase} representing the binary expression
$\texttt{left\_operand} \leq \texttt{right\_operand}$
denoting wether the left value is lower than or equal to the right value.\newline

\noindent{}This library provides \textit{BinaryFunctor}         specializations for
\texttt{LEFT\_OPERAND} and   \texttt{RIGHT\_OPERAND} being     floating point types
which compute if \texttt{left\_operand}                   is lower than or equal to
\texttt{right\_operand}. \texttt{result\_type} is \texttt{bool}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{\texttt{struct greater\_than\_functor}}
A \textit{BinaryFunctorBase} representing the binary expression
$\texttt{left\_operand} > \texttt{right\_operand}$
denoting wether the left value is greater than the right value.\newline

\noindent{}This library provides \textit{BinaryFunctor}         specializations for
\texttt{LEFT\_OPERAND} and   \texttt{RIGHT\_OPERAND} being     floating point types

\section{\texttt{struct greater\_than\_or\_equal\_to\_functor}}
A \textit{BinaryFunctorBase} representing the binary expression
$\texttt{left\_operand} \geq \texttt{right\_operand}$
denoting wether the left value is greater than or equal to.\newline

\noindent{}This library provides \textit{BinaryFunctor}         specializations for
\texttt{LEFT\_OPERAND} and   \texttt{RIGHT\_OPERAND} being     floating point types
